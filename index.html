        My Dearest [NellyNetice],
        
        In a span of two years, my heart has been struggling with silent melodies of admiration. From shadows, I've admired your strength, kindness and the radiant spirit that you carry within.Your laughter is a melody that brightens my darkest days.Your mere presence is a calming force that brings peace to the chaos of my world, that is the reason I usually text missing your whenever I realize you are not around. Today, courage rises to confess my love for you, a treasure no longer hidden.
I may have kept my love a secret, but my feelings for you are a treasure I can no longer hide. You deserve to know the depth of my affection, the sincerity of my admiration to you.

I understand the beauty of your spirit, and I respect the essence of who you are. Whether my love finds a place in your heart or not, know that it is a love that has been pure, genuine, and unwavering.
With all the courage I can muster and all the love my heart can hold, I hope these words find a special place in your heart.Waiting to hear from you.
        Yours always,
        [John Miregwa]"></textarea>
